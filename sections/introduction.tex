\section{Introduction}
In analytic geometry, points can be represented as a vector
that can be transformed by translation, rotation, and reflection transformations.
However, the particular system requires a more complicated model.
For instance, to simulate the image of a black hole according to general relativity
which is influenced by the curvature of the spacetime
causing the coordinate system to change and imply the usage of a different model.

The model varies between the curvature of the manifold
and the manifold can be separated into pieces with constant curvature.
Those pieces can then be grouped into three categories
with different properties and coordinate systems:
manifold with positive, negative, and no curvature.

Therefore, we develop an algebraic model for geometries on the manifold with constant intrinsic curvature
which can simulate geometric transformations and is compatible with the existing model
to unify the current models and enhance the understanding of the model.
