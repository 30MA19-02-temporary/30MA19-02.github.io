\section{Results}
After we developed an algebraic model for geometries on the manifold with constant intrinsic curvature,
we proceed to develop a JavaScript module to calculate transformations and projections according to the model
and implemented a static website for users to visually interact with the model.
The website includes several example such as
the transformation of entire 2-dimensional manifold
with arbitary intrinsic curvature
and its projections including
Equirectangular, Orthographic, Gnomonic, Stereographic, Poincare half-plane, and Hemispherical projections.
The website can be accessed from
