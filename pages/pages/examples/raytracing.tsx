        To calculate the image, Beltramiâ€“Klein / Gnomonic projection should be used. It map the geodesic into
        straight line and thus will let the renderer work without much modification. Still, the distance should be
        mapped to make it realistic.

        The problem left is how to define shapes. Parametic curve can be used for sphere. Polyhedra, however, may
        need extra work to calculate possible regular polyhedra.
